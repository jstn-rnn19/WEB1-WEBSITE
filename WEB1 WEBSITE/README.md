The 50/30/20 Budgeting Rule Explained
The 50/30/20 Rule is a straightforward, balanced budgeting method designed to simplify your finances and ensure you are saving consistently. It dictates that you divide your after-tax income (or salary) into three broad categories: 50% for Needs, 30% for Wants, and 20% for Savings and Debt Repayment.

The goal of this rule is to create a sustainable financial habit, preventing the endless cycle of tracking dozens of small categories. TrackTics is built around this simple framework to make budgeting effortless.

## there category
1. Needs	50%	Essential expenses you must pay to maintain life and employment. If you lost your income, these are the payments you would struggle to defer. Examples: Rent/Mortgage, Groceries, Transportation Costs (Gas/Transit Pass), Minimum Loan Payments, Insurance, Utilities.
2. Wants	30%	Discretionary spending that improves your quality of life but isn't strictly necessary. These are often the first items to cut when tightening a budget. Examples: Dining Out, Entertainment (Movies, Streaming), Hobbies, Clothing (Beyond necessary work attire), Vacations, Gym Memberships.
3. Savings & Debt	20%	Future-focused funds dedicated to improving your long-term financial health. This 20% is non-negotiable for building wealth. Examples: Emergency Fund Contributions, Retirement Investing, Aggressive Debt Repayment (extra payments above the minimum), Long-Term Savings Goals (e.g., down payment).
